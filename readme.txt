- Very basic UTManager
- Created 21/04/19
- version 0.01



I was bored, and I've been reading a c++ book, so I made my first c++ application in about 5-6 years.


Install:

Place UTManager.exe in your UnrealTournament main directory. e.g "C:/unrealtournament/"



How to use:
Double click UTManager.exe and it will convert all cache files into their real file names so unrealtournament can use them offline.





Included source just in case someone wanted to try it/ compile in on their machine.




I do intend on adding more features at a later date.
